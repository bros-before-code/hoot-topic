Not just maple! Several tree species produce delicious, tap-worthy sap.  
Here are the top 5 trees you can use to make syrup.

## 1. Sugar Maple (_Acer saccharum_)

> 🍁 **Sap Sugar Content**: ~2%  
> 🌎 **Found**: Eastern North America  
> 🧴 **Flavor**: Rich, classic maple syrup

The Sugar Maple is the **gold standard** for syrup. Its high sugar content and smooth flavor make it the most efficient and widely used tree for syrup production.

## 2. Black Maple (_Acer nigrum_)

> 🍁 **Sap Sugar Content**: ~2%  
> 🌎 **Found**: Midwest and Northeast U.S.  
> 🧴 **Flavor**: Slightly darker and robust

Closely related to the sugar maple, the Black Maple produces similarly sweet sap. It’s often used as a substitute and offers a slightly stronger flavor.

## 3. Red Maple (_Acer rubrum_)

> 🍁 **Sap Sugar Content**: ~1.5%  
> 🌎 **Found**: Eastern North America  
> 🧴 **Flavor**: Milder than sugar maple

Red Maples bud earlier in spring, which shortens the tapping season. Still, they’re a great option for syrup, especially where sugar maples are less common.

## 4. Boxelder (_Acer negundo_)

> 🍁 **Sap Sugar Content**: ~1%  
> 🌎 **Found**: Throughout North America  
> 🧴 **Flavor**: Earthy and mild

This fast-growing, hardy tree is technically a maple and makes a **surprisingly decent syrup**. It's perfect for small-batch backyard tapping.

## 5. Birch (_Betula spp._)

> 🍁 **Sap Sugar Content**: ~0.5–1%  
> 🌎 **Found**: Northern climates  
> 🧴 **Flavor**: Caramel-like and unique

Though low in sugar, birch sap can be boiled down to a syrup with a **rich, molasses-like taste**. Popular in Alaska, Scandinavia, and parts of Russia.

> 🌳 **Fun Fact**: It takes roughly **40 gallons of sap** to make **1 gallon of maple syrup** — but even more for birch or boxelder!
