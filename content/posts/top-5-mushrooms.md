Nature hides danger in plain sight — especially among mushrooms.  
Here are the top 5 most poisonous mushrooms in the world.

## 1. Death Cap (_Amanita phalloides_)

> ☠️ **Toxin**: Amatoxins  
> 📍 **Found**: Europe, North America, Asia  
> ⚠️ **Fatal dose**: One mushroom

Responsible for most mushroom-related deaths worldwide, the Death Cap resembles edible varieties — making it especially dangerous. Symptoms are delayed, often too late for effective treatment.

> 📍 **Found**: North America, Europe  
> ⚠️ **Fatal dose**: A few bites

This all-white mushroom may look harmless, but it causes irreversible liver and kidney damage. Its name says it all.

> ☠️ **Toxin**: Orellanine  
> 📍 **Found**: Europe and North America  
> ⚠️ **Symptoms**: Can take days to appear

The Deadly Webcap looks like an edible chanterelle. Once consumed, it attacks the kidneys — often requiring dialysis or transplant.

## 4. Podostroma Cornu-damae

> ☠️ **Toxin**: Trichothecene mycotoxins  
> 📍 **Found**: Asia (especially Japan, Korea)  
> ⚠️ **Effect**: Multi-organ failure

With its eerie red “antlers,” this rare fungus is extremely toxic. Ingesting even a small amount can lead to rapid organ shutdown and death.

## 5. Autumn Skullcap (_Galerina marginata_)

> ☠️ **Toxin**: Amatoxins  
> 📍 **Found**: Worldwide  
> ⚠️ **Lookalike**: Edible honey mushrooms

The Autumn Skullcap grows on decaying wood and is often mistaken for edible varieties. Like others on this list, it contains deadly amatoxins that attack the liver.

> 🍄 **Fun Fact**: There’s no easy way to tell poisonous mushrooms from edible ones just by looking — always forage with an expert or avoid wild mushrooms entirely.
